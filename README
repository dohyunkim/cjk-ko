CJK-ko package version 2.5 (2024/03/01)
=======================================

This package supports typesetting of modern Korean documents with the help
of LaTeX2e CJK package written by Werner Lemberg. Unlike CJK package,
only UTF-8 input encoding is supported. This package however provides
some enhanced features focused on Korean typesetting culture, one of them
being allowing line-break between Latin and CJK characters.

Currently this package requires nanumtype1 package.

    \usepackage[cjk]{kotex}

    [hanja]
Load Hanja captions. same as [hangul] option for line/word spacing.

    [nojosa]

automatically.

    [usecjkt1font]
CJK fonts will be used for Latin characters as well. Only Nanum T1 font is
currently available.

    [mj=<font>], [gt=<font>]
Declare Myeongjo (serif) and Gothic (sans-serif) font families respectively.
`c70<font>.fd` should be existant.

    [truetype]
When TrueType fonts are declared by mj or gt option, it is recommended to
declare this option as well, which enables text extraction from resulting PDF.

Other unknown options will be passed to CJKutf8.sty.


User commands
-------------

    \CJKscale
- scale font size of CJK character
- eg: \CJKscale{0.95}
- cannot be used with [usecjkt1font] option
- allowed only in the preamble
- under [hangul] option, line/word spacing and indent size are
  adjusted automatically

    \lowerCJKchar
- lower CJK characters
- eg: \lowerCJKchar{0.1em}
- cannot be used with [usecjkt1font] option
- allowed only in the preamble

    \dotemph
- emphasize Hangul or Hanja by putting dot above
- eg: \dotemph{드러냄표}
- available only when [usedotemph] option is given
- users can redefine these commands:

    \def\dotemphchar{\Unicode{"02}{"D9}}
    \def\dotemphraise{0.2em}

For other commands see CJK package documents.


Automatic Josa selection
------------------------

Josa commands:

    \은 \는 \이 \가 \을 \를 \와 \과 \로 \으로 \라 \이라

example:

    \label{fig:aaa} ... \ref{fig:aaa}\을
    \label{fig:aaa} ... \pageref{fig:aaa}\을
    \cite{hong}\을 ... \bibitem[홍길동]{hong}
    \cite{king}\을 ... \bibitem[King\jong]{king}

Automatic Josa selection works correctly only after
\ref \pageref \cite commands and recognises only the last Ascii
or Hangul character in the sequence.
For other cases these commands are available:

    \jung:  sequence is terminated by Jungseong
    \jong:  sequence is terminated by Jongseong
    \rieul: sequence is terminated by Jongseong Rieul


Korean counters
---------------

Same as ko.TeX package:

    \jaso \gana \ojaso \ogana \pjaso \pgana \onum \pnum \oeng \peng
    \hnum \Hnum \hroman \hRoman \hNum \hanjanum
